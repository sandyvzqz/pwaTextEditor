## Description
The purpose of this challenge was to create a text editor app that can function online and offline, using react and react libraries. The app also had to meet Progressive Web Application criteria, and have a folder structure consistent with pwa. 

## Installation 
To run the app successfully, these steps are recommended:
- Clone the git repository
- Next, run 'npm install' in the terminal, to install all required app packages
- To begin using the app, run 'npm run start'
- Edit text online and offline using Jate!
  
## Usage
This text editor runs in the browser and feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The app can also be installed by clicking 'install' in the deployed app link. This app utilizes the IndexedDB database API to store and retrieve data entered into the text editor.  

## Demo 
This is a video demonstrating the functionality of the finished app.
